# Error Handling and Resilience

Handling errors gracefully is crucial for a robust autonomous agent that interacts with unpredictable external services. Here's how the Faraday agent approaches error handling:

## Explicit Error Handling Mechanisms

1.  **Tool-Level Error Catching (`research_system/tools.py`)**: 
    *   Most functions that call external APIs (e.g., `tavily_search`, `firecrawl_scrape_tool`, `news_search`) are wrapped in `try...except` blocks.
    *   These blocks catch common exceptions that might occur during API calls (e.g., network errors, authentication issues, rate limits, invalid inputs, API-specific errors).
    *   When an exception is caught, instead of crashing the agent, the tool function typically:
        *   Logs the error for debugging purposes (using Python's `logging`).
        *   Returns a specific error message string (e.g., "Tavily search failed: [error details]", "Firecrawl scrape failed for [URL]: [error details]").
    *   This error message becomes the "observation" passed back to the agent.

2.  **Agent-Level Error Processing (`research_system/agent.py`)**: 
    *   The LangGraph definition includes nodes or logic specifically for handling errors passed back from tools or occurring within the agent's own processing steps.
    *   The `process_tool_result` node checks if the observation returned from `execute_tool` indicates an error (e.g., by checking if the string starts with "Error:" or matches a known failure pattern).
    *   If an error is detected from a tool:
        *   The error message is often added to a dedicated `error_messages` field within the `ResearchState` or appended to the `intermediate_steps` with an error flag.
        *   The agent (LLM) is informed of the failure in its next reasoning step. It might then decide to:
            *   Retry the same tool (perhaps with modified input if applicable).
            *   Try an alternative tool (e.g., use DuckDuckGo if Tavily failed).
            *   Ignore the failed step and proceed with other research avenues.
            *   Conclude that it cannot proceed further due to the error.

3.  **Graph-Level Error Handling**: LangGraph itself provides mechanisms to catch unhandled exceptions within graph nodes.
    *   There is often a dedicated `handle_error` node connected via edges from various points in the graph where failures might occur (e.g., tool execution, report generation).
    *   This node captures the exception, formats an appropriate error message, stores it in the `ResearchState` (e.g., in the `final_report` field formatted as an `ErrorResponse`), and transitions the graph to the `END` state.
    *   This ensures that even unexpected failures result in a controlled termination and an informative error message being returned to the user via the Streamlit interface.

4.  **Configuration Validation (`research_system/config.py`)**: Initial configuration loading often includes checks for necessary API keys. If keys are missing, the application might raise an error early, preventing the agent from starting in an invalid state.

## Implicit Resilience

*   **LLM Adaptability**: The core LLM, guided by the `AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT`, has some inherent ability to adapt. If a tool fails or returns poor results, the prompt encourages iterative refinement and trying different approaches or tools. This provides a degree of resilience even without explicit error branches for every possible failure.
*   **FINISH Condition**: The requirement for the agent to explicitly call `FINISH` prevents it from getting stuck in infinite loops if it encounters persistent issues or cannot find relevant information.
*   **Timeout Handling**: While not explicitly shown in all tool examples, robust implementations would include timeouts for external API calls to prevent the agent from hanging indefinitely.

## Limitations

*   The agent's ability to recover depends heavily on the quality of the error messages returned by tools and the LLM's capacity to understand those messages and formulate a new plan.
*   Complex failure scenarios (e.g., subtle data corruption, logical errors in the agent's reasoning) might not be caught by simple exception handling.

Overall, the system combines explicit error catching at the tool and graph levels with the adaptive nature of the LLM to handle common issues encountered during web research.
